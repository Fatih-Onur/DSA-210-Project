## Project Overview

Over the next three months, I’ll be diving deep into how my daily habits impact my one-rep max Bench Press performance. By analyzing factors like caloric intake, protein, carbohydrates, creatine consumption, sleep (both duration and quality), and body weight, I aim to uncover which habits drive the best results. Using data visualization and statistical tools, I’ll explore patterns and test whether specific tweaks to my routine can lead to measurable improvements.

The plan is simple: track my daily routines, correlate them with my Bench Press performance, and test hypotheses about what really makes a difference. Ultimately, I want this project to provide actionable insights to optimize my training and nutrition strategies.
