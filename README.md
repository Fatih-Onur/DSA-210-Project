# FOOTBALL TEAMS EXPENDITURE TO SUCCESS-DSA_210_project

## Project Overview

This project investigates how English Premier League teams' transfer market activities—such as transfer expenditures, player acquisitions and departures, and financial returns—correlate with their on-field performance measured by league standings and points. Using data sourced from Transfermarkt, the study will employ exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling across multiple seasons to uncover trends and assess the impact of financial investments.
The main goal is to find out whether spending big money in to new star players really help a team's short term success. If it helps how much it helps and which factors are most crucial along the transfer window.
This investigation can be done with every football leagueand every season as long as we have meaningful data on, However; I will be studying on English Premier League since it is the most valuable and most watched league across the world(Also most money spending league).
